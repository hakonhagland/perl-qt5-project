:camel: Open source contribution project :camel:

## Description
- Continue unfinished the work
  by [chrisburel/perlqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt) (see   the `qt5` branch)
- The project seems to have been abandoned in 2018, last commit was Nov 2018 and the
  author's GitHub
  [home page](https://github.com/chrisburel?tab=overview&from=2022-03-01&to=2022-03-03) shows
  no activity since 2020.

## Aim

- Upload a working Qt5 module to CPAN
- Module should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Learn about Qt
- Learn about cmake
- Learn about [Perl xs](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs)
  and [Perl internals](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi)
- Have fun :smiley:
- Contribute to the Perl ecosystem

## Source code repository

The work should be done (by submitting pull requests)
to the `main` branch
of [hakonhagland/perlqt](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perlqt) which
