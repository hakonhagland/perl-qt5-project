- [Ruby bindings to Qt: development of the upstream qtruby/smoke has ended](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings/issues/131)

- [Ruby binding to Qt: project is no longer maintained](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings)
 It only supports Qt4 which the latest linux distributions no longer include in their package repos. No future releases or changes are planned. If you would like to take over, please fork, and make the changes to support Qt5/Qt6. This will be really difficult as the Smoke libraries used in this project do not work well with C++11+
