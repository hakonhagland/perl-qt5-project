# State of current Perl Qt5 bindings

- The code
in [hakonhagland/perlqt](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perlqt)
repository which is direct fork of the `qt5` branch
in [chrisburel/perlqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt) does
currently not build, see [this issue](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt/issues/1).

- First thing it needs in order to build is the `smokegen` binary.
  I am able to build `smokegen` using the version
  in [commonqt/smokegen](https://github.com/commonqt/smokegen), see
  below for more information.

- Using the above `smokegen` when
  building
  [hakonhagland/perlqt](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perlqt) gives
  error _"Could not find Smoke QtCore"_, see build log [here](Compile_hh_perlqt_with_smokegen.md).

- It appears that we first need to build something called
  `smokeqt`. The original version of smokeqt
  in [crisburel/smokeqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokeqt) depend
  on [chrisburel/smokegen](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokegen)
  which does not compile.

- So I think we need to compile the version of smokeqt
  in [commonqt/smokeqt](https://github.com/commonqt/smokeqt) which
  depends on [commonqt/smokegen](https://github.com/commonqt/smokegen)
  which I am now able to compile, see below.

- However, building
  of [commonqt/smokeqt](https://github.com/commonqt/smokeqt)
  currently fails with
  `'windows.h' file not found`, see build log [here]()
# State of smokegen binary

- The code in [chrisburel/perlqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt) seems to depend
  on (see [this issue](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt/issues/1))
  SMOKE binding generated by
  [chrisburel/smokegen](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokegen). The
  latter seems to be abandoned September 2019 and the code currently
  does not compile on Ubuntu, see compile log
  [here](Compile_smokegen_chrisburel.md).
  It looks like it was trying to use
  Clang tooling libraries to port SMOKE bindings from Qt4 to Qt5, but
  maybe it became too involved, or something else
  stopped the development? There are signs (see below) that most
  language bindings to Qt are having trouble with SMOKE and Qt5 and they
  are trying to find alternative solutions.

- However, [commonqt/smokegen](https://github.com/commonqt/smokegen)
  which is a fork and further development
  of [chrisburel/smokegen](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokegen)
   seems to have been able to port smokegen to Qt5 for Common
  Lisp's [CommonQt5](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5). See
  also [mcristg/smokegen](https://github.com/mcristg/smokegen), [CommonQt](https://commonqt.common-lisp.dev/) and [Shinmera/qtools](https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools)

- I am currently able to build `smokegen`
  in [commonqt/smokegen](https://github.com/commonqt/smokegen),
  see [this](https://github.com/commonqt/smokegen/pull/1) pull
  request, [this](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5/issues/4)
  issue
  and [this](Compile_smokegen_commonqt.md) page for building the prerequisites.

# More information about CommonQt

- CommonQt might drop SMOKE support in the future, see [The qt-libs Reference Manual](https://quickref.common-lisp.net/qt-libs.html#Introduction) :

> In the future, CommonQt will use its own system to hook into Qt and drop Smoke support. When that time comes, this project will hopefully become obsolete. However, for the time being, Smoke is a necessary evil, and as such, this library hopes to make things a bit easier.

- There is a currently an effort going on to build [Shinmera/qt-libs](https://github.com/Shinmera/qt-libs) with Qt5, see [this](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5/issues/2) issue. More information about qt-libs can be found [here](https://shinmera.github.io/qt-libs/).

- [Ruby binding to Qt: project is no longer maintained](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings): Quote:
  *"It only supports Qt4 which the latest linux distributions no longer
  include in their package repos. No future releases or changes are
  planned. If you would like to take over, please fork, and make the
  changes to support Qt5/Qt6. This will be really difficult as the
  Smoke libraries used in this project do not work well with C++11+"*
