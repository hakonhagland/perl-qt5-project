# State of SMOKE bindings to Qt

- The code in [chrisburel/perlqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt) seems to depend
  on (see [this issue](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt/issues/1)
  SMOKE binding generated by
  [chrisburel/smokegen](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokegen)
  which seems to be abandoned in September 2019. The code currently
  does not compile on Ubuntu, see
  [Compile_smokegen_chrisburel](Compile_smokegen_chrisburel.md).
  It looks like it was trying to use
  Clang tooling libraries to port SMOKE bindings from Qt4 to Qt5, but
  maybe it became too complicated to do that? Or something else
  stopped the development. There are signs (see below) that most
  language bining to Qt are having trouble with SMOKE and Qt5 and they
  are trying to find alternative solutions.

- However, [mcristg/smokegen](https://github.com/mcristg/smokegen) seems to have been able to port smokegen to Qt5 for Common Lisp's [CommonQt5](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5), see also [CommonQt](https://commonqt.common-lisp.dev/) and [Shinmera/qtools](https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools)

- Still CommonQt might drop SMOKE support in the future, see [The qt-libs Reference Manual](https://quickref.common-lisp.net/qt-libs.html#Introduction) :

> In the future, CommonQt will use its own system to hook into Qt and drop Smoke support. When that time comes, this project will hopefully become obsolete. However, for the time being, Smoke is a necessary evil, and as such, this library hopes to make things a bit easier.

- There is a currently an effort going on to build [Shinmera/qt-libs](https://github.com/Shinmera/qt-libs) with Qt5, see [this](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5/issues/2) issue. More information about qt-libs can be found [here](https://shinmera.github.io/qt-libs/).

- [Ruby binding to Qt: project is no longer maintained](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings): Quote:
  *"It only supports Qt4 which the latest linux distributions no longer
  include in their package repos. No future releases or changes are
  planned. If you would like to take over, please fork, and make the
  changes to support Qt5/Qt6. This will be really difficult as the
  Smoke libraries used in this project do not work well with C++11+"*
