# State of SMOKE bindings to Qt

- [chrisburel/perlqt](https://github.com/chrisburel/perlqt) seems to depend
  on SMOKE binding generated by [chrisburel/smokegen](https://github.com/chrisburel/smokegen) which seems to be abondoned in september 2019. It seems like it was trying to use clang tooling libraries to port SMOKE bindings from Qt4 to Qt5, but maybe it became too difficult to do that? 

- However [mcrist/smokegen](https://github.com/mcristg/smokegen) seems to have been able to port smokegen to Qt5 for Common Lisp's [CommonQt5](https://github.com/commonqt/commonqt5), see also [CommonQt](https://commonqt.common-lisp.dev/) and [Shinmera/qtools](https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools)

- [Ruby binding to Qt: project is no longer maintained](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings): Quote:  
  *"It only supports Qt4 which the latest linux distributions no longer
  include in their package repos. No future releases or changes are
  planned. If you would like to take over, please fork, and make the
  changes to support Qt5/Qt6. This will be really difficult as the
  Smoke libraries used in this project do not work well with C++11+"*
